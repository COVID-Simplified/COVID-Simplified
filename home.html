    <h3>Why we created this website</h3>
    <img class="webpic" src = "../Images/logo.png">

    <p class="web-paragraph">COVID-19 has been an unprecedented problem for the world. We wanted to inform people about what is happening and how to stay safe.
      We then realized that there are already several websites that contain information about the virus. When looking through these,
      we noticed that most websites were geared towards adults, rather than kids. This made us think. Rather than creating another website whose main target was adults,
      what if we made a website for kids? This is when our idea for COVID Simplified was born.</p>
