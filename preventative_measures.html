      <h2 id="wear-a-mask">Wear a Mask</h2>

              <h3>Which mask to use?</h3>
                <p>You should wear a mask that first properly and make sure that it always
                  covers your nose and mouth. A mask will be extremely helpful in keeping you
                  and others safe. Always make sure that your mask completely covers your nose and mouth.
                    This is VERY important for safety. Otherwise, your mask will not work
                    properly.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
              <h3>How to wash</h3>
              <p>Wash your mask whenever it is used. If your mask is disposable, throw it away
                    after wearing it once.</p>
            <br>
            <li>
              <h3>When not to wear a mask</h3>
                <ul>
                  <li>If you are in a restaurant, only remove your mask while eating and remain at least
                    6 feet away from other diners.</li>
                  <li>When swimming, don't wear a mask. This is because a wet mask can quickly become
                    difficult to breathe in and may not work as well.</li>
                  <li>If you are exercising or doing something that requires a lot of breathing, choose an
                    open space. The outdoors is a good open area to use. Also, try to stay at least 6 feet
                    away from other people at all times.</li>
                </ul>
                <br>
                <p>Keep in mind that you will have a higher chance of getting the virus if you are not wearing
                  a mask or <a href="#social-distancing">social distancing</a> when around other people.</p>
            </li>
            <br>
            <li>
                <h3>Warnings and Additional Info</h3>
                  <p>Always wear a mask when around people who don't live in your household if you are of age two or
                    older. Keep in mind that wearing a mask does not mean that you don’t have to <a href="#social-distancing">social distance</a>.
                    Always do both when outside. Additionally, <a href="#cleaning-your-hands">wash your hands properly</a> after touching or removing your mask</p>
            </li>
          </ul>

      <h2 id="social-distancing">Social Distancing</h2>
      <br>
        <p>Social distancing is staying 6 feet away from other people. While this does not mean that you
          don’t have to wear a <a href="#wear-a-mask">mask</a>, social distancing from other people can help prevent the spread of
          COVID-19. Staying away from other people can stop the number of droplets that land in the mouth or noses
            of people nearby.</p>

      <h2 id="using-tissues">Using Tissues</h2>
      <br>
        <p>Since COVID-19 <a href="What_is_COVID.html#how-it-spreads" target="_blank">spreads</a> through droplets in the air, sneezing or coughing can spread this virus to
          other people. Use a tissue to block these droplets and make sure to throw it away properly afterward.
          Also, make sure to <a href="#cleaning-your-hands">wash your hands</a> after using a tissue.</p>

      <h2 id="dont-touch-your-face">Don't touch your face</h2>
      <br>
        <p>It is important to try not to touch your face when outside or even at home. The germs on your hands can end up on your
           face and increase the chance that you get sick. If you need to touch your face, make sure to wash your hands properly before doing so.</p>

      <h2 id="stay-home-if-sick">Stay home if sick</h2>
      <br>
        <p>If you are sick, stay at home so that you don't spread your sickness to others. This is crucial to
            stopping the spread of the virus. Even if you have the flu or something else, stay home. You could
            get other people sick, and it becomes serious, they would add to the number of people in the hospitals.
            However, if you are really not well and need to go to the hospital or receive other kinds of help, it is ok
            to leave your home. Just make sure to follow all of the preventive measures listed on this page. It is
            generally recommended to stay at home unless necessary.</p>

      <h2 id="cleaning-your-hands">Cleaning your hands</h2>
      <br>
          <p>Washing your hands is very important for staying safe. Your hands gather germs throughout the day, so
             washing your hands often is extremely important. A good, effective way to wash your hands is to use water,
             soap, and then more water to wash the soap off. When using soap, you should scrub your entire hand. This
             includes the back of your hand, in-between your fingers, and their tips. When you are scrubbing your hands
             with soap, you should sing the Happy Birthday song twice before washing the soap off your hands with water.
             This will kill most of the germs on your hand and you can stay healthy and safe! When soap and water are not
            available you should use hand sanitizer. This is slightly less effective than soap and water, but it can be an
            easy and fast alternative. Before using the hand sanitizer, check if the bottle has at least 60% alcohol. If it
            is less than 60%, the hand sanitizer may not be as effective.</p>

      <h2 id="disinfect">Disinfect</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Clean surfaces or objects that are frequently touched. This includes electronics such as a phone or tablet. Make sure
        to use a proper disinfectant and follow the instructions. For example, some disinfectants need to be left on the surface
        for a minute to be fully effective. If someone has the virus and touches one of these objects, the next person
        to touch it could get the virus.</p>

      <h2 id="when-to-travel">When to travel</h2>
      <br>
      <p>Only travel if necessary so that you limit the spread of COVID-19. If you are going to meet someone, make sure that
        they are not at <a href="What_is_COVID.html#people-at-higher-risk" target="_blank">increased risk</a> of catching the virus. Do not go to places where many people will be close together
        such as weddings, funerals, parties, concerts, or parades.</p>
