        <h2 id="about-the-virus">About The Virus</h2>
        <p>COVID stands for, "Coronavirus Disease." It is a type of virus. A virus is a microscopic organism that essentially
          reproduces by taking over your cell. It is a respiratory virus. This means that it affects
          your lungs and other parts of your body involved with breathing. This virus spreads through
          droplets in the air, mainly from coughing or sneezing. You will learn more about this in the
          <a href="#symptoms">symptoms</a> section.
        </p>

        <h2 id="how-it-all-began">How it all began</h2>
        <p>On December 31, 2019, the World Health Organization(WHO) said that a mysterious disease was
          sickening dozens of people in China. Also, many of the people who were sick had visited an animal
          market in Wuhan, China. The first coronavirus death was in China on January 11, 2020. This was a
          61-year-old man who had visited that very same market. The first coronavirus case was identified
          in the US 10 days after. It was a man from Washington state who had recently been to Wuhan. On
          January 30, 2020, WHO declared a global health emergency. The first COVID-19 death in the US was
           on February 6 in Santa Clara, California. Then, on March 13, 2020, President Trump declared a
           national emergency. The total number of coronavirus cases in the world hit 1 million on April 2, 2020.

        <h2 id="how-it-spreads">How it spreads</h2>

        <p>There are a few ways that COVID-19 can spread. You can be safer by understanding these.</p>

          <br>

          <ul>
            <li>The virus can spread through the air through actions such as sneezing and coughing. </li>
            <li>It can through contact with other people who have COVID. Some examples of this would be shaking
                hands or hugging an infected person.</li>
            <li>Lastly, the virus can spread when touching something that has the virus. Suppose someone who had
              COVID touched an object, such as a door handle. If someone else touched that same object, the
              virus could have been passed on.</li>
          </ul>

        <br>
        <p>Inform family and friends about the way the virus spreads so that everyone can stay safe and healthy.</p>

        <h2 id="people-at-higher-risk">People at higher risk for COVID-19</h2>
        <p>Some people are at a higher risk of developing severe symptoms for COVID-19 than others. If you
           fall under one or more of the categories below, make sure to follow the guidelines listed
           extremely carefully(as should everyone).</p>
        <br>

          <li>65 or older
              <ul>
                <li>The risk of developing severe symptoms increases with age. People 85 and older are at
                  the highest risk. Also, in the U.S., about 80% of deaths from the virus have been people
                  65 or older.</li>
              </ul>
